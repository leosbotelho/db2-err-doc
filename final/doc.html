  <summary class='tree-nav__item-title'>Explanation</summary>
  <div class='tree-nav__item'>
    <p>Characters were truncated when data was transferred between a remote data source and the federated server. Truncation can occur in many situations. Some of these situations include an incorrect nickname column definition (a column is too small for the remote data source column data), or the presence of a conversion or type-cast function that restricts the size of the data returned by the remote data source.</p>

</details><details class='tree-nav__item is-expandable'>
  <summary class='tree-nav__item-title'>User Response</summary>
  <div class='tree-nav__item'>
    <p>To correct this problem, examine the statement for any type-cast or conversion functions that
might be restricting the size of data returned from the remote data source. If the statement
contains these functions, recode the statement to allow larger data to be returned from the data
source. Then submit the statement again. If the statement does not contain these functions, or if
correcting the functions does not correct the problem, examine the local column specification in the
nickname in the DB2 catalog. Using the ALTER NICKNAME statement or DROP NICKNAME and CREATE NICKNAME
statements, change the column specification to ensure that the column size is large enough to
accommodate the data returned by the remote data source.</p>

    <p>In most situations, you can choose to ignore this warning because the failure to preserve the previous access plan can be the result of normal and expected database object changes or database configuration changes. In some circumstances, you might want to monitor the performance of the queries or use the explain facility to examine the access plans and compare them to the access plans generated in the past for the same query. You can then follow accepted query performance tuning and monitoring procedures to verify that the query performs well, or if necessary, improve the performance. To avoid having this warning returned, take one of the following actions based on the reason code:</p>

<dl>

<dt class="dlterm">101</dt>

<dd class="dlentry"><p>Bind or rebind the package with a version of at least DB2 Version 9.7 before enabling the access plan reuse option of the BIND, REBIND, or PRECOMPILE command.</p>

<dt class="dlterm">103</dt>

<dd class="dlentry"><p>Bind or rebind the package with the installed version or a version whose access plans are supported for access plan reuse by the installed version before enabling the access plan reuse option of the BIND, REBIND, or PRECOMPILE command.</p>

If this SQLCODE was returned because the cost category value

    <p>The query optimizer uses statistics to determine the best access plan for a query.  When inconsistent statistics are present, the optimizer performs access plan evaluation with information that is less accurate then if a consistent set of statistics was available.  This might result in an access plan that is not optimal.</p>

<p>Possible causes of this warning include the following.</p>

<ol>
<li>Issuing RUNSTATS on the table only may result in a situation where the table level statistics are inconsistent with the already existing index level statistics.  Likewise, issuing RUNSTATS for indexes only or during index creation may leave table level statistics in an inconsistent state.  For example, if index level statistics are collected on a particular table and later a significant number of rows is deleted from this table, issuing RUNSTATS on the table only may end up with the table cardinality less than FIRSTKEYCARD which is an inconsistent state.</li>

<li>If a RUNSTATS is issued with the ALLOW WRITE ACCESS option when many inserts, updates, or deletes are occurring concurrently, then inconsistencies may occur because of table changes between the time that table and index statistics are collected.</li>

<li>If a RUNSTATS is issued with the TABLESAMPLE option, then an excessively low sample size may cause statistics to be inaccurately extrapolated, resulting in inconsistencies.  The chance of inaccurate extrapolation is higher for SYSTEM sampling than for BERNOULLI sampling.</li>

  <div class='tree-nav__item'>
    <p>Changing the database configuration parameter (DB config parameter) DECFLT_ROUNDING may have several unintended consequences.  Any calculation using the DECFLOAT data type could produce a different result with the new rounding mode.</p>

<p>The following is a list of some of the most significant consequences:</p>

<ul>
<li>Previously constructed MQTs could contain results that differ from what would be produced with the new rounding mode.</li>

<li>A trigger whose execution is potentially dependent on rounding mode could produce different results now, based on the new rounding mode.  However, even if the results of a trigger can be affected by the rounding mode, changing it will have no effect on data that was already written.</li>

<li>It is possible for constraints that allowed data to be inserted into a table, will now, if re-evaluated, reject that same data. Similarly it is possible for constraints that did not allow data to be inserted into a table, would now, with the new rounding mode, accept that same data.</li>

<li>The value of a generated column whose calculation is dependent on DECFLT_ROUNDING could be different for two rows identical except for the generated column value, if one row was inserted before the change to DECFLT_ROUNDING and the other was inserted after. 
<ul>
<li>Note: rounding mode is not compiled into packages, so static SQL does not need to be recompiled after changing DECFLT_ROUNDING.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The value of the configuration parameter was not changed dynamically but will only become effective after all applications disconnect from this database. If the database was activated, it must be deactivated.</p>
  </div>
</details><details class='tree-nav__item is-expandable'>
  <summary class='tree-nav__item-title'>User Response</summary>
  <div class='tree-nav__item'>
    <p>To rectify the MQT issue, refresh any MQTs potentially impacted by rounding mode. Evaluate and correct any issues related to triggers affected by rounding mode manually.</p>

<p>To rectify the presence of data in a table which now violate a constraint based on the new rounding mode, use SET INTEGRITY to check for rows that violate the constraint based on the new rounding mode. To rectify the generated column issue, use SET INTEGRITY with the FORCE GENERATED option on tables with generated columns which could be affected.</p>

<p>Alternatively, change the rounding mode database configuration parameter (DB config parameter) DECFLT_ROUNDING back to its prior value to avoid all of the potential consequences indicated in this message.</p>

<p>To have the new value for the configuration parameter come into effect, disconnect all applications from this database.  If the database was activated, it must be deactivated.</p>

    <p>Table <var class="keyword varname">table-name</var> is a system-period temporal table. The table includes a period <var class="keyword varname">period-name</var>.  The requested data change operation was performed and resulted in an adjustment to a recorded time value for the  period. This can occur for one of the following reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>Two transactions are accessing the same row. The transaction that started first has a statement that is updating or deleting the row after a statement in the second transaction has already changed that row. This results in the timestamp value in the row begin column being the start time of the second transaction. The first transaction cannot update or delete a row if the row begin time stamp on that row is later than when the first transaction started.</li>

<li>Data has been loaded into the system-period temporal table with values for the row begin column that override the generated values. The row begin column value that was loaded is in the future relative to the timestamp that the executing transaction would use.</li>

<p>In SQL statements with host variables, use the host variable number to count in from the beginning of the statement (or substatement, in the case of compound SQL) to locate the invalid host variable.  For statements using an SQLDA, the SQLVAR number is used to locate the invalid SQLVAR.  For an input SQLDA, count only input host variables or SQLVARs; similarly for output. Note that this number is based at 1.</p>

<p>If <var class="keyword varname">protocol</var> is TCP/IP, here are descriptions of some common scenarios:</p>

<ul>
<li>Reason codes <var class="keyword varname">rc1</var>, <var class="keyword varname">rc2</var>, <var class="keyword varname">rc3</var> represent: 
<ul>
<li>If present, <var class="keyword varname">rc1</var> contains the errno returned by the  TCP/IP function. On Windows, this is a WSA errno.</li>

<li>If present, <var class="keyword varname">rc2</var> contains the h_errno value returned by a TCP/IP name resolution function. On Windows, this is a WSA error number.</li>

<li>If <var class="keyword varname">rc3</var> is present and contains &quot;0&quot;, the remote side has  terminated the connection. If the error was received on the  client, then the remote side could be a server or gateway. If  the error was received on the gateway, the remote side could be  the client or server.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>If <var class="keyword varname">protocol</var> = TCP/IP, <var class="keyword varname">rc1</var>=*, <var class="keyword varname">rc2</var>=*, and <var class="keyword varname">rc3</var>=0, possible causes include: 
<ul>
<li>The database agent at the server was forced off by the system administrator.</li>

<li>A database agent could not be started at the server because a memory limitation was reached on the system.</li>

<li>The connection might have been closed by the remote server at the TCP/IP level.</li>

<li>The database agent at the server was terminated due to an abnormal termination of a key database manager process.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>On Windows, if <var class="keyword varname">protocol</var> = TCP/IP, <var class="keyword varname">function</var> = WSAStartup,  and <var class="keyword varname">rc1</var> = 0, then <var class="keyword varname">rc2</var> contains the Windows Sockets  Specification version level requested by DB2, and <var class="keyword varname">rc3</var> contains  the Windows Sockets Specification version level supported by the Windows  Sockets DLL. Cause: There was a version level mismatch.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>If <var class="keyword varname">protocol</var> = TCP/IP, <var class="keyword varname">function</var> = connect, <var class="keyword varname">rc1</var> = ECONNREFUSED/WSAECONNREFUSED, AIX (79), Windows (10061), linux (111), SUN (146), HP (239), the attempt to connect was rejected. Possible causes: 
<ul>
<li>The remote database server has not been cataloged correctly  at the client. In a client-gateway-server scenario, ensure  the host entries are cataloged correctly on the gateway.</li>

<li>The database manager configuration file at the server has not  been configured properly with the proper communication  parameters. Check that the SVCENAME database manager configuration parameter has been configured properly  with the TCP/IP service name or port number and that the port  number is unique. If database manager configuration parameters  have been updated at the server, the database manager must be  stopped and re-started for the changes to take effect. There  might be a mismatch between the TCP/IP service name or port  number specified on the server and on the client. Ensure the  service name maps to the correct port number by checking the  services file. You can check this by reading the services file  or checking the output from running the command &quot;netstat -a&quot;.</li>

<li>A firewall at the remote database server has prevented the connection from being established. Verify that the firewall is properly configured to accept connection requests from the client.</li>

<li>The DB2COMM environment variable at the server does not  specify the communication protocol used  by the client.  Check that TCPIP has been specified. Issue db2set to see  what has already been set. Run the command &quot;db2set DB2COMM=TCPIP&quot;  to set the value.</li>

<li>The database manager at the server has not been started, or  has not been started successfully, or has gone down. The  server should have returned SQL1063N, and not SQL5043N. If  you set the database manager configuration parameter DIAGLEVEL to 4 using the command &quot;db2 update dbm cfg using diaglevel 4&quot; prior to issuing the &quot;db2start&quot; command, then the administration notification  log will provide detailed information on which protocols  were started successfully. Check the administration  notification log.</li>

<li>The server might be too busy to handle the volume of incoming connections at this time.</li>

<li>Network failure, contact your network administrator.  You can try a test using the protocol tester, pctt,  to verify this is not a DB2 problem.</li>
</ul>

<li>If <var class="keyword varname">protocol</var> = TCP/IP, <var class="keyword varname">function</var> = connect, <var class="keyword varname">rc1</var> = ETIMEDOUT/WSAETIMEDOUT, AIX (78), Windows (10060), linux (110), SUN (145), HP (238), attempt to connect timed out before a connection was made. Possible causes: 
<ul>
<li>An incorrect host name or IP address was cataloged in the hostname field of the node directory on the client and/or gateway.</li>

<li>The network is slow, or the server might be too busy to respond to the connect request within a reasonable amount of time, you might need to adjust your system TCP connect timeout value and/or the DB2TCP_CLIENT_CONTIMEOUT value.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>If <var class="keyword varname">protocol</var> = TCP/IP, <var class="keyword varname">function</var> = recv, <var class="keyword varname">rc1</var> = ECONNRESET/WSAECONNRESET, AIX (73), Windows (10054), linux (104), SUN (131), HP (232), the connection was reset by the remote side executing a &quot;hard&quot; or &quot;abortive&quot; close. Possible causes: 
<ul>
<li>The connection might have been closed by the remote gateway or  server at the TCP/IP level (eg. firewall problem, power failure,  network failure).</li>

<li>Client side connection pooling is enabled and is not handling connection failures. Code the application to retry a connection if a failure is received when connecting to the database and connection pooling is enabled.</li>

<li>Might have been caused by a thread timeout on the host machine. Check the  system log on the host for the presence of the IDTHTOIN message.  Adjust the setting if applicable. If this cannot be adjusted, either  disable connection pooling on the gateway, or ensure all objects  are properly closed (eg. cursors with hold when the application  completes its operation).</li>

<li>The database agent at the server was forced off by the database administrator.</li>

<li>The database agent at the server was terminated due to an abnormal termination of a key database manager process.</li>

Possible causes: 
<ul>
<li>SQLCancel() was called from a CLI application because the application  set the Query Timeout value or there was an explicit cancel request.  Adjust the Query Timeout value set by the application. If this is  not possible, adjust the QueryTimeoutInterval setting in the  db2cli.ini file. Use QueryTimeoutInterval=0 (no timeout) in the  db2cli.ini file to test whether QueryTimeout is the cause of your  application&#39;s failure. The failure of an existing connection is  expected in this scenario.</li>

<li>The network is slow, or the server might be too busy to respond to the recv request within a reasonable amount of time, you might need to adjust your system TCP recv timeout value.</li>
</ul>

Possible causes: 
<ul>
<li>Either the system connect timeout or the timeout value set by DB2TCP_CLIENT_CONTIMEOUT caused the timeout. Try adjusting these values.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>If <var class="keyword varname">protocol</var> = TCP/IP, <var class="keyword varname">function</var> = selectForRecvTimeout, <var class="keyword varname">rc1</var> is irrelevant, the recv request timed out before it could complete successfully. Possible causes: 
<ul>
<li>Either the system recv timeout or the timeout value set by DB2TCP_CLIENT_RCVTIMEOUT caused the timeout.  Try adjusting these values.</li>
</ul>

<p>If <var class="keyword varname">protocol</var> is APPC</p>

<ul>
<li><var class="keyword varname">rc1</var> contains the return code from the CPI-C function.</li>

<li>If present, <var class="keyword varname">rc2</var> contains the global errno value from the CPI-C function call.</li>

<li><var class="keyword varname">rc3</var> is not applicable.</li>
</ul>

<p>If <var class="keyword varname">protocol</var> is MQ</p>

<ul>
<li><var class="keyword varname">rc1</var> contains the function completion code, 1 for a warning and 2 for an error.</li>

<li><var class="keyword varname">rc2</var> contains the MQ-specific error code.</li>

<li><var class="keyword varname">rc3</var> is not used for MQ.</li>

    <p>The DB2 database system requires that your instance and database directories, and the files in those directories, have a minimum level of operating system permissions. When the instance and database directories are created by the database manager the permissions are accurate, and changing those permissions could cause database manager functions to fail. The complexity of DB2 file permissions is increased in the case of non-root installed instances and operating system-based authentication.</p>

<p>This message is returned when security-related database manager executable files do not have necessary permissions for the database manager to perform remote connection authentication-related tasks.</p>

<p>There are several reasons why these security-related files might not have the necessary permissions, including the following reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>The database manager instance is a non-root installed instance and operating system-based authentication has not been enabled using the db2rfe command</li>

<li>Operating system permissions of database manager files were accidentally changed</li>

<p>A LOB value can be assigned to a  locator variable by means of a SELECT INTO statement, a VALUES  INTO statement, or a FETCH statement.</p>

<p>Result set locator values are returned  by the ASSOCIATE LOCATORS statements.  Result set locator values are only  valid as long as the underlying SQL cursor is open.

<p>If the following statements are all true about the application code:</p>

<ul>
<li>the application contains a cursor declared for a query that defines a result set containing LOB columns</li>

<li>the cursor declaration contains the WITH HOLD clause</li>

<ul>
<li>Precompile your application again using the PREP command making sure to include the SQLRULES STD option.</li>

<p>The following rules apply to types that are used in expressions:</p>

<li>The operands of a union, intersect, or except operator must contain items that are nodes only.</li>

<li>The operands of an arithmetic expression cannot be sequences of length greater than one.</li>

<li>The operands of a node comparison must be either single nodes or empty sequences.</li>

<li>In general, atomization must not result in more than one atomic value.</li>

<li>When atomization is applied to a comparison expression, the result of atomization must be single atomic values, where the value of the first atomized operand is comparable with the value of the second atomized operand.</li>

<li>When atomization is applied to a name expression, the result of atomization must be a single atomic value of type xs:QName, xs:string, or xdt:untypedAtomic.</li>

<li>The content sequence of a document node constructor cannot contain attribute nodes.</li>

<li>When (item(), item()+) appears as the <var class="keyword varname">value-type</var>, a sequence of 2 or more items is being used in an expression where a single item is expected.</li>

<li>The orderspec values in an order by clause must be convertible to a common type.</li>

<li>A value that is bound to a variable must match the declared type (if a type is declared).</li>

<li>The cast of a value of source type <var class="keyword varname">value-type</var> to target type <var class="keyword varname">expected-type</var> must be a supported cast. In cases where SQL processing invokes XQuery to perform a cast from an XML data type to an SQL data type other than XML, an XQuery cast is performed with a temporary derived XML schema type that is generated using a name based on the SQL data type and associated size restrictions. For example, the <var class="keyword varname">target-type</var> token value is &quot;VARCHAR_50&quot; for an XMLCAST to VARCHAR(50) and &quot;DECIMAL_9_2&quot; for an XMLCAST to DECIMAL(9,2).</li>

The following situations might cause this error:</p>

<ul>
<li>A <var class="keyword varname">value</var> was passed to a constructor function that required a value of

<li>A <var class="keyword varname">value</var> was explicitly passed to a cast function or specified in 
a cast expression with a target data type of <var class="keyword varname">datatype</var>.</li>

<li>An expression that included <var class="keyword varname">value</var> implicitly cast the value to the
target data type of <var class="keyword varname">data-type</var>. Many XQuery expressions use implicit 
casting to process the expressions. For example, implicit casting is used in 
general comparisons of numeric values that 
require the values to be of data type xs:double.</li>

<li>In cases where SQL processing invokes XQuery to perform a cast from an XML
value <var class="keyword varname">value</var> to an SQL data type other than XML, an XQuery cast is performed
with a temporary derived XML schema type that is generated using a name based on
the SQL data type and associated size restrictions.  For example, the
<var class="keyword varname">data-type</var> token value is &quot;VARCHAR_50&quot; for an XMLCAST to VARCHAR(50) and
&quot;DECIMAL_9_2&quot; for an XMLCAST to DECIMAL(9,2).</li>

<p>If the value for <var class="keyword varname">name</var> is of the form &quot;TBSPACEID=n1, TABLEID=n2, COLNO=n3&quot;, you can determine the table name and column name using the following query:</p>

      AND C.TABSCHEMA = T.TABSCHEMA
      AND C.TABNAME = T.TABNAME</code></pre>
<p>The table and column identified by this query may be the base table of a view for which the SQL statement failed.</p>

<p>If the error is returned as part of an alter table statement, when setting a column to NOT NULL, modify any row data for the column that contains the NULL value, and retry the statement.</p>

<p>Federated system users: if the reason is unknown, isolate the problem to the data source failing the request and examine the object definition for that data source. Remember that the defaults (NULL and NOT NULL) are not necessarily the same between data sources.</p>

<p>For HBase or Hadoop users, verify that the data in the underlying data files is correct, or use ALTER TABLE to change the nullability of the column.</p>

    <p>The INSERT or UPDATE object table <var class="keyword varname">table-name</var> is constrained by one or more UNIQUE indexes to have unique values in certain columns or groups of columns. Alternatively, a DELETE statement on a parent table caused the update of a foreign key in a dependent table <var class="keyword varname">table-name</var> that is constrained by one or more UNIQUE indexes. Unique indexes might support primary keys or unique constraints defined on a table. The statement cannot be processed because completing the requested INSERT, UPDATE or DELETE statement would result in duplicate column values. If the index is on an XML column, the duplicate values for the index key may be generated from within a single XML document.</p>

<p>Alternatively, if a view is the object of the INSERT or UPDATE statement, it is the table <var class="keyword varname">table-name</var> on which the view is defined that is constrained.</p>

<p>If <var class="keyword varname">index-id</var> is an integer value, the index name can be obtained from SYSCAT.INDEXES by issuing the following query:</p>

<pre class="codeblock"><code>SELECT INDNAME, INDSCHEMA
  FROM SYSCAT.INDEXES

<p>For an UPDATE statement, ensure that the specified operation is not itself inconsistent with the uniqueness constraint. If this does not show the error, examine the object table content to determine the cause of the problem.</p>

<p>For an INSERT statement, examine the object table content to determine which of the values in the specified value list violates the uniqueness constraint. Alternatively, if the INSERT statement contains a subquery, the object table contents addressed by that subquery must be matched against the object table contents to determine the cause of the problem.  Note that if the table is protected using a security policy, your LBAC credentials may not allow you to see the rows that are causing the error.</p>

<p>If the index is on an XML column and the statement is either INSERT or UPDATE, consider whether the XML document would result in duplicate values from within the single XML document.</p>

<p>For a DELETE statement, examine the identified dependent table for unique constraints on foreign keys that are defined with the rule ON DELETE SET NULL.  This table has a foreign key column included in the identified unique index that cannot be set to null since there is already a null in the column for that table.</p>

<p>The federated transaction manager performs some transaction management functions on behalf of the transaction manager, and communicates with the transaction manager using an XA interface.

    <p>The DB2 architecture is designed so that applications run in a different address space than the database server.  Running applications in a different address space prevents application programming errors from overwriting database manager internal buffers or files, and prevents application errors from crashing the database manager. The fenced mode process (db2fmp) is responsible for executing fenced stored procedures and user-defined functions in a different address space than the database server.</p>

<p>This message is returned when the db2fmp process terminates abnormally while running the named routine.  The db2fmp process could have terminated abnormally for many reasons, including the following reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>There was a coding error, such as division by zero or an out-of-bounds pointer reference, in the implementation of the stored procedure or user-defined function that the db2fmp process was executing.</li>

<li>Another process terminated the db2fmp process using a signal, such as the termination signal SIGTERM.</li>

<li>SQLJ.INSTALL_JAR failed while installing a Java routine because the fenced user does not have permission to create or write to the necessary directories on the server.</li>

  <div class='tree-nav__item'>
    <p>Respond to this error by performing the following steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>Ensure that there are no coding errors in the stored procedure or user-defined function that could result in abnormal termination by reviewing and unit-testing the stored procedure or user-defined function code.</li>

<li>Ensure that other application or users will not send termination signals to the db2fmp process by reviewing the activities of all applications that are running on the system and users who are accessing the system.</li>

<li>Run the stored procedure again.</li>
</ol>

<p>If this message was returned because SQLJ.INSTALL_JAR fails, add the fenced ID to the instance owner&#39;s group.</p>

    <p>A savepoint is a named entity that represents the state of data and schemas at a particular point in time within a unit of work.  You can use savepoints in several ways.  For example, you can roll a database back to a savepoint.  You can set a savepoint within a transaction using the SAVEPOINT statement.  In some environments, you can also set multiple, or nested, savepoints within the same transaction.</p>

<p>This message can be returned when an error occurred in a SAVEPOINT statement or atomic compound SQL statement for the following reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>An attempt has been made to set a nested savepoint, but a savepoint already exists and nested savepoints are not supported in this environment.</li>

    <p>The changes associated with the unit of work must be entered again.</p>

<p>To help avoid deadlock or lock timeout, issue frequent COMMIT operations, if possible, for a long-running application, or for an application likely to encounter a deadlock.</p>

<p>Federated system users: the deadlock can occur at the federated server or at the data source.  There is no mechanism to detect deadlocks that span data sources and potentially the federated system.  It is possible to identify the data source failing the request (refer to the problem determination guide to determine which data source is failing to process the SQL statement).</p>

<p>Deadlocks are often normal or expected while processing certain combinations of SQL statements.  It is recommended that you design applications to avoid deadlocks to the extent possible.</p>

<p>If a deadlock state was reached because of a queuing threshold such as the CONCURRENTDBCOORDACTIVITIES threshold, increase the value of the queuing threshold.</p>

<p>If the deadlock state was reached because the application is waiting for resources governed by workload manager admission control, increase the resourceshare for the service class in which the last statement of the application was executing. To help avoid deadlocks involving resources governed by workload manager admission control, reduce the number of concurrently executing SQL statements in applications by closing SQL cursors when they are no longer needed.</p>

    <p>There is an error in the data type specification in a CREATE or ALTER statement, or a CAST specification. An invalid length, precision or scale attribute may have been specified, or it may be that the data type itself is incorrect or not permitted in this context.  The location of the error is given by <var class="keyword varname">data-item</var> as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>For a CREATE or ALTER TABLE statement, <var class="keyword varname">data-item</var> gives the name of the column containing the error or the data type containing an error. If the column data type is a structured or XML data type, then the INLINE LENGTH value must be at least 292 and cannot exceed 32673. For a LOB data type, the INLINE LENGTH value must be at least the size of the LOB descriptor (see the CREATE TABLE statement) and cannot exceed 32673</li>

<li>For a CREATE FUNCTION statement, <var class="keyword varname">data-item</var> is a token that identifies the area of the problem in the statement. For example, &quot;PARAMETER 2&quot; or &quot;RETURNS&quot; or &quot;CAST FROM&quot;. In some cases, it may also be the data type containing the error.</li>

<li>For a CREATE DISTINCT TYPE statement, <var class="keyword varname">data-item</var> gives the name of the type being defined or the source data type containing the error.</li>

<li>For a CREATE TYPE(array) statement, <var class="keyword varname">data-item</var> gives the data type containing an error.  The integer value specified inside the square brackets must be an integer greater than or equal to 1 and not larger than 2147483647.</li>

<li>For a CREATE or ALTER TYPE statement, <var class="keyword varname">data-item</var> gives the type of the attribute containing the error or the name of the structured type having an incorrect inline length value. The inline length cannot be smaller than 292 and the size returned by the constructor function for the structured type.</li>

<li>For a CREATE VARIABLE statement, <var class="keyword varname">data-item</var> gives the name of the variable having an incorrect data type. The data type of a global variable can be of any built-in data type with the exception of LONG types, LOBs, ARRAY, and structured types. Distinct types and reference types are supported.</li>

<li>For CAST( expression AS data-type ), <var class="keyword varname">data-item</var> is &quot;CAST&quot; or the data type containing the error.</li>

<li>For XMLCAST( expression AS data-type ), data-item is &quot;XMLCAST&quot; or the data type containing the error.</li>

<li>For a reverse type mapping, [p..p] expression cannot be used for the remote data type. For example, the following statement (reverse type mapping) is incorrect.  
<pre class="codeblock"><code>CREATE TYPE MAPPING tm1
       FROM SERVER drdasvr TYPE CHAR([1..255])
       TO SYSIBM.VARCHAR</code></pre>
<p>Whereas, the following statement (forward type mapping) is correct.</p>

<pre class="codeblock"><code>CREATE TYPE MAPPING tm1
      TO SERVER drdasvr
      TYPE CHAR([1..255])
      FROM SYSIBM.VARCHAR</code></pre></li>
</ul>

<p>Federated system users: if the statement is a CREATE TYPE MAPPING statement, an attempt was made to create a type mapping where a type attribute for either the local data type or the remote data type is not valid. Possible reasons include:</p>

<ul>
<li>The local length/precision is set to 0 or a negative value.</li>

<li>The length/precision attribute is specified for data types such as date/time/timestamp, float, or integer.</li>

<li>The scale attribute is specified for data types such as character, date/time/timestamp, float, or integer.</li>

<li>The FOR BIT DATA clause is specified for a non-character type.</li>

<li>The remote precision is set to 0 for remote types other than Informix datetime.</li>

<li>An invalid field qualifier is being used in a type mapping for an Informix datetime type.</li>

<li>An ending value is lower than the starting value in a precision/scale range.</li>
</ul>

<p>The statement cannot be processed.</p>

<li>The object identified by <var class="keyword varname">name</var> is not defined in the database.</li>

<li>The object identified by <var class="keyword varname">name</var> is defined in a module and is not a published module object and it was referenced from outside the module.</li>

<li>The data partition identified by <var class="keyword varname">name</var> is not defined on the table.</li>

<li>A data type is being used. This error can occur for the following reasons: 
<ul>
<li>If <var class="keyword varname">name</var> is qualified, then a data type with this name does not exist in either the schema that matches the qualifier or the module that matches the qualifier that was found first based on user&#39;s SQL path.</li>

<li>If <var class="keyword varname">name</var> is unqualified, then the user&#39;s path does not contain the schema to which the desired data type belongs or the data type is not defined in the module if the reference is within a module routine.</li>

<li>The data type does not exist in the database with a create timestamp earlier than the time the package was bound (applies to static statements).</li>

<li>If the data type is in the UNDER clause of a CREATE TYPE statement, the type name may be the same as the type being defined, which is not valid.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>A function is being referenced in one of: 
<ul>
<li>a DROP FUNCTION statement</li>

<li>a COMMENT ON FUNCTION statement</li>

<li>the SOURCE clause of a CREATE FUNCTION statement  
<p>If <var class="keyword varname">name</var> is qualified, then the function does not exist.  If <var class="keyword varname">name</var> is unqualified, then a function of this name does not exist in any schema of the current path.</p>

<p>Note that a function cannot be sourced on the COALESCE, DBPARTITIONNUM, GREATEST, HASHEDVALUE, LEAST, MAX (scalar), MIN (scalar),  NULLIF, RID, NVL, RAISE_ERROR, TYPE_ID, TYPE_NAME, TYPE_SCHEMA, or VALUE built-in functions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>The element named <var class="keyword varname">name</var> is used on the right side of the UNDER clause in CREATE SECURITY LABEL COMPONENT statement but has not yet been defined as being ROOT or being UNDER some other element</li>

<li>The security label component element named <var class="keyword varname">name</var> has not yet been defined.</li>

<li>One of the following scalar functions specified a security policy identified by <var class="keyword varname">name</var> which is not defined in the database. 
<ul>
<li>SECLABEL</li>

<li>SECLABEL_TO_CHAR</li>

<li>SECLABEL_BY_NAME</li>

<p>This return code can be generated for any type of database object.</p>

<p>Federated system users: the object identified by <var class="keyword varname">name</var> is not defined in the database or <var class="keyword varname">name</var> is not a nickname in a DROP NICKNAME statement.</p>

<p>Some data sources do not provide the appropriate values for <var class="keyword varname">name</var>.

For missing data  type or function in SOURCE clause, it may be that the object does not exist, OR it may be that  the object does exist in some schema, but the schema is not present in your path.</p>

<p>For the CREATE or ALTER SECURITY LABEL COMPONENT statement, make sure that each element specified  as a reference element value for positioning the location of a new element value already exists in  the security label component.</p>

<li>A CREATE TABLESPACE or ALTER TABLESPACE statement included a container that is already in use by another table space.</li>

<li>A CREATE TABLESPACE or ALTER TABLESPACE statement included a container from a table space that has been dropped but the drop statement has not been committed.</li>

<li>An ALTER DATABASE PARTITION statement used to add a database partition used the containers of a LIKE database partition that is on the same physical database partition. These containers would therefore already be in use.</li>

<li>A CREATE TABLESPACE or ALTER TABLESPACE statement is attempting to use the same container on more than one logical database partition on a single physical database partition. The same containers cannot be used for more than one database partition on the same physical database partition.</li>

<li>An ADD DATABASE PARTITION command or API used the containers from the system temporary table spaces of a LIKE database partition that is on the same physical database partition. These containers would therefore already be in use.</li>

<li>A CREATE TABLESPACE statement, ALTER TABLESPACE statement, or CREATE DATABASE command  included a DMS container from another database that no longer exists but  was not dropped properly.  The container is not actually in    use but it is tagged as being in use.  Therefore, the DB2 data server will not allow it to be used until it is untagged.  However, it is  very important to verify that the container is not in use by   the same database or another database when untagging it.  If   the container is in use when you untag it, the database (or databases) involved will be corrupted.</li>

<li>A REORG attempted to automatically select a DMS temporary table space  for use, and although one with the correct page size exists, it is  currently in use by another REORG command.</li>

<li>The ADD DBPARTITIONNUM option of the REDISTRIBUTE command, which was used to add a  database partition, creates table space container names on the newly added database partition  based on the table space container names of the table spaces on the lowest numbered database  partition. If these container names specify absolute paths, and if the new database partition  is on the same physical device as a database partition using the same container names, then  the containers for the new partition would already be in use.</li>

<li>A RESTORE DATABASE command has found containers from a database that no longer exists but was not dropped properly.</li>

<li>A temporary staging database was created for a transport operation, and then an attempt was made to create a table space on the target database while the temporary staging database still exists.</li>

    <p>Ensure the containers are unique.</p>

<ul>
<li>For the CREATE or ALTER TABLESPACE statement, specify a different container for the table space.</li>

<li>For the CREATE or ALTER TABLESPACE statement including a container from a dropped table space, try again after the drop statement is committed or specify a different container.</li>

<li>For the ALTER DATABASE PARTITION statement, reissue the statement using the WITHOUT TABLESPACES clause, and then use the ALTER TABLESPACE statement to create unique containers for the new database partition.</li>

<li>For CREATE or ALTER TABLESPACE statements where the environment includes more than one logical database partition on a physical database partition, ensure that the same containers are not specified for such logical database partition.</li>

<li>For an ADD DATABASE PARTITION command or API, reissue the statement using the WITHOUT TABLESPACES clause, and then use the ALTER TABLESPACE statement to create unique containers at the new database partition for the system temporary table spaces.</li>

<li>If you are trying to use a DMS container that belonged to a    database that no longer exists but was not dropped properly,   then the db2untag utility can be used to remove the DB2      container tag from it.  When this tag is removed DB2     considers the container to be free and the container can be    used in a CREATE TABLESPACE statement,  ALTER TABLESPACE statement, or CREATE DATABASE command. 
<p>NOTE: Use extreme caution with db2untag. If you issue a db2untag command against a container that is still in use by a database, then both the database that originally used the container and the database that is now using the container will be corrupted.</p>
</li>

<li>For REORG, resubmit the command once the initial REORG that is using  the required table space completes, or provide another temporary  table space of the correct page size for use.</li>

<li>For the REDISTRIBUTE command, instead of using the ADD DBPARTITIONNUM option, before issuing the  REDISTRIBUTE command issue the ALTER DATABASE PARTITION GROUP statement using the WITHOUT TABLESPACES  clause, and then use the ALTER TABLESPACE statement to create unique containers for the new database  partition.</li>

<li>For the RESTORE DATABASE command (where a container belongs to a database that no longer exists but was not dropped properly), remove the container. 
<p>NOTE: Ensure that the container is not in use by another database prior to removing it.</p>
</li>

<li>If a temporary staging database was created for a transport operation, remove the temporary staging database after the staging database is no longer needed, and then attempt operations on the target that were blocked as a result of the existence of the staging database.</li>

<ul>
<li>For views, expression-based indexes, or materialized query tables dependent on the table, query SYSCAT.VIEWDEP, where the table matches the BSCHEMA and BNAME columns.</li>

<p>If the error pertains to a RENAME COLUMN action of an ALTER TABLE statement, the column cannot be renamed directly  while the target table is a history table. The column can be renamed by taking one of the following actions.</p>

<ul>
<li>Determine the name of the system-period temporal table that uses the history table and issue the RENAME COLUMN  operation with that name as the target of the ALTER TABLE statement. This renames the column in both  the system-period temporal table and the associated history table.</li>

<li>Determine the name of the system-period temporal table and issue the DROP VERSIONING operation with that name  as the target of ALTER TABLE statement. This changes the history table and the system-period temporal table into  a regular tables. You can now rename the column of the table in your original ALTER TABLE statement. Note that  if the column is renamed, the table can no longer be the history table for the table on which versioning was  dropped.</li>

    <p>The function <var class="keyword varname">function-name</var> with specific name <var class="keyword varname">specific-name</var> is defined with the MODIFIES SQL DATA property. Functions with this property are only allowed as the last table reference in a select-statement, common-table-expression, RETURN statement that is a subselect, SELECT INTO statement, or row-fullselect in a SET statement.  As well, each argument to the table function must be correlated to a table reference in the same FROM clause as the table function, and every table reference must be correlated to by some argument in the table function. An argument is correlated to a table reference when it is a column of that table reference.</p>

<p>Reason-code:</p>

<ol>
<li>There are table references following the table function.</li>

<li>The table function is not referenced in the outer most subselect.</li>

<li>The table function is preceded by a table reference which is not referenced by a function argument.</li>

<li>The table function is  used in the body of a view definition.</li>

<li>The table function is used in a fullselect within an XQuery context.</li>

<li>The table function is referenced by an OUTER JOIN operator or is nested within other explicit joins (using parentheses in a joined-table clause).</li>

<li>The function is referenced in the default clause for a global variable or parameter of a procedure definition.</li>
</ol>

<p>The statement cannot be processed.</p>
  </div>
</details><details class='tree-nav__item is-expandable'>
  <summary class='tree-nav__item-title'>User Response</summary>
  <div class='tree-nav__item'>
    <ol>
<li>Rewrite the query so that the table function is the last table reference in the FROM clause.</li>

<li>Move the table function to be in the outermost subselect.</li>

<li>Remove the table reference not correlated to in the table function or include an argument in the table function that correlates to the table reference.</li>

<li>Remove the table function from the body of the view definition.</li>

<li>Remove the table function from the fullselect in the XQuery context.</li>

<li>Remove the OUTER JOIN operator or do not place table function in a nested explicit join.</li>

<li>Remove the function from the default clause for the global variable or parameter of a procedure definition.</li>
</ol>

<p>For reason codes 1, 2, and 3, the query can be rewritten using a common table expression to isolate the table function invocation.  For example:</p>

<pre class="codeblock"><code>SELECT c1 FROM
   (SELECT c1 FROM t1, t2,
     TABLE(tf1(t1.c1) AS tf), t3)
      AS x, t4</code></pre>
<p>Can be rewritten as:</p>

<pre class="codeblock"><code>WITH cte1 AS (SELECT c1 FROM t1,
   TABLE(tf1(t1.c1)) AS tf),
   x AS (SELECT c1 FROM t2, cte1, t3)

<li>The string constant beginning with <var class="keyword varname">string</var> has a length greater than 32672 bytes. Character strings with lengths greater than 32672 bytes or graphic strings with lengths greater than 16336 characters can be specified only through assignment from host variables. Note that other servers in the DB2 family of products may specify a different size limit for character strings. Consult the documentation for the appropriate database product for details.</li>

<li>In an XQuery expression, a string literal beginning with <var class="keyword varname">string</var> has a length greater than 32672 bytes. The limit is determined on the string literal encoded in UTF-8. A string with length greater than 32672 bytes can only be specified in an XQuery expression using XML values from the database through the XQuery functions that access data or through an XQuery variable assigned a value using SQL/XML functions like XMLQUERY, XMLEXISTS, or XMLTABLE.</li>

<li>Federated system users: the data source-specific limits must not be exceeded in a pass-through session. For example, a character literal larger than 254 bytes included in a statement sent to DB2 for OS/390 in a pass-through session would cause this error.</li>

<li>The job ID string on the INGEST command is greater than 128 bytes.</li>

<li>The date, time, or timestamp format string in a field definition on the INGEST command is greater than its maximum length.  Date format strings have a maximum length of 10 bytes.

<p>It may be that data conversion is occurring and the resultant string is too long.  For connections between applications and databases running under different codepages, string constants are converted from the application codepage to the database codepage.  In certain situations, graphic string constants may be further converted from the database codepage to a UCS-2 (UNICODE) encoding, for example when the database has been created with an EUC codepage. This means that it is possible to have a resultant string which is longer than the input string.</p>

<p>Federated system users: for a pass-through session, determine what data source is causing the error. Examine the SQL dialect for that data source to determine which specific limit has been exceeded, and adjust the failing statement as needed.</p>

<p>The row size limit is the maximum number of bytes of a given table. This limit consists of a defined value in some cases or a variable value that depends on the table space page size.</p>

<p>In a column-organized table, a column size limit consists of the maximum size of an uncompressed column data value that can fit on one page of the table.</p>

    <p>To resolve the issue reported by this message, perform the following steps:</p>

<p>For row size limits:</p>

<ol>
<li>Calculate the row size of the table that you are trying to create or modify.</li>

<li>Determine the limit or restriction exceeded by the row size. 
<ul>
<li>For row-organized tables: the row size limit is determined by the table space page size.</li>

<li>For column-organized tables: the limit is the column-organized table maximum row size.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Perform one of the following actions: 
<ul>
<li>Reduce the row size by reducing the lengths of one or more columns, specifying a different data type, or eliminating one or more columns.</li>

<li>For row-organized tables only: Specify in the statement a table space with a page size that fits the row size that you calculated.</li>

<li>If reducing the row size or finding a table space with a larger page size is not possible, enable the extended row size configuration parameter, extended_row_sz, which allows row length to exceed the maximum record length for the page size of the table space.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<p>For column size limits:</p>

<ol>
<li>Determine the maximum column size for the table that you are trying to create or modify, based on the column type and the underlying page size.</li>

<li>Reduce the length of the affected column so that it does not exceed the limit.</li>

<dt class="dlterm">A database manager agent was unavailable</dt>

<dd class="dlentry"><ul>
<li>The database manager was stopped or had not been started on the database server.</li>

<li>An administrator forced a database agent off the system.</li>

<li>A database manager process terminated abnormally.</li>

</dd>


<dt class="dlterm">The user ID had insufficient authority</dt>

<dd class="dlentry"><ul>
<li>The user ID was forced off of the system when another user with SYSADM authority issued a FORCE QUIESCE command. The FORCE QUIESCE command forces off of the system all users who do not have CONNECT QUIESCE authority for the database or instance or who do not belong to a group that has CONNECT QUIESCE authority.</li>

<li>In Windows operating system environments: Extended Security was enabled, and the user ID was not a member of the DB2USERS or DBADMINS group.</li>
</ul>
</dd>


<dt class="dlterm">Database directory conflicts</dt>

<dd class="dlentry"><ul>
<li>There were two databases, one local and one remote, with the same database name and same database alias.</li>

<li>A local database was cataloged as a remote database.</li>

<li>After a change was made to the way that one or more databases were cataloged, the changes did not take effect because the database manager is still using a cached copy of the database cataloging information.</li>

<dd class="dlentry"><ul>
<li>The application was using more transaction log space than allowed by the max_log database configuration parameter or the num_log_span database configuration parameter.</li>

<li>There were insufficient coordinator agents to process the application requests. Applications that hold locks in WITH HOLD cursors and are queued for execution in concentrator mode might cause active agents to be held up waiting for those locks.</li>

<li>The connection was idle for longer than the time specified in the CONNECTIONIDLETIME threshold.</li>

<li>A unit of work on the connection lasted longer than the time specified in the UOWTOTALTIME threshold and the connection was terminated because the threshold action specified FORCE APPLICATION.</li>

    <p>Reconnect to the database.</p>

<p>If the connection continues to fail, perform the following troubleshooting steps with the assistance of a database administrator:</p>

<ol>
<li>Federated environments only: Determine whether it is a federated data source that is returning the error or the federated database server that is returning the error.</li>

<li>Ensure that client/server configuration is correct: 
<ol type="a">
<li>Confirm whether the communication subsystem (including network cables, network cards, and communication protocols such as TCP/IP) is up and running.</li>

<li>In client/server environments using the TCP/IP protocol: Assign the same port number to the TCP/IP service name on the client as the port number on the server.</li>
</ol>
</li>

<li>Ensure the database manager is up and running: 
<ol type="a">
<li>Determine whether the database manager is up and running.</li>

<li>Review the db2diag log files for evidence that a database manager process was interrupted or terminated abnormally.</li>

<li>If the database manager is stopped, or if there is evidence in the diagnostic logs of any database manager agents being interrupted or terminating abnormally, restart the database manager.</li>
</ol>
</li>

<li>Ensure that the user ID has authority: 
<ul>
<li>If the database or instance was quiesced, take one of the following actions: 
<ul>
<li>Unquiesce the database or instance.</li>

<li>Add the user ID to the group that has CONNECT QUIESCE authority.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>In Windows operating system environments: If Extended Security is enabled, add the appropriate user ID to the local Windows security group DB2USERS or DB2ADMNS.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Remove any database directory conflicts: 
<ol type="a">
<li>Compare the contents of the local database directory and the system catalog to the database configuration.  In particular, look for the following problems: 
<ul>
<li>Ensure that no two databases have the same name or alias as each other.</li>

<li>Ensure that local database are cataloged as local, and that any remote databases are cataloged as remote.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>After making any changes to the ways databases have been cataloged, stop and restart the database manager instance.</li>
</ol>
</li>

<li>Make necessary configuration and application changes to avoid exceeding database or operating system limits:
<p>Determine which limit was exceeded by reviewing db2diag log files, and then make one or more of the following changes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Reduce the chance of applications being forced off for using too much transaction log space by make one or more of the following changes: 
<ul>
<li>Alter the application to issue more frequent commit statements.</li>

<li>Increase the max_log database configuration parameter or the num_log_span database configuration parameter.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Reduce the chance of applications being forced off because there are insufficient coordinator agents by make one or more of the following changes: 
<ul>
<li>Increase the value of max_coordagents relative to the value of max_connections.</li>

<li>Reduce the use of WITH HOLD cursors.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Reduce the chance of connections being closed for being idle for too long by increasing the CONNECTIONIDLETIME threshold.</li>

<li>Reduce the chance of connections being closed because a unit of work is taking too long to execute by increasing the UOWTOTALTIME threshold.</li>

<li>Reduce the chance of queries timing out by increasing the SQL_ATTR_QUERY_TIMEOUT statement attribute or using the QueryTimeoutInterval CLI/ODBC configuration keyword.</li>

<li>In AIX, 32-bit environments: reduce the chance of running out of AIX shared memory by making one or more of the following changes: 
<ul>
<li>Catalog the database as a loopback data source using TCP/IP.</li>

<li>If the application is using multiple contexts with local protocol, then either reduce the number of connections in the application, or switch to another protocol, such as TCP/IP.</li>

<li>Set the EXTSHM parameter if the application supports the EXTSHM parameter and if there are sufficient memory resources to use the parameter.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Alter the application as needed to avoid unsupported usage scenarios: 
<ul>
<li>To avoid connecting to a DB2 member that is in restart light mode, either specify a member that is not in restart light mode, or do not specify any specific member and allow the database manager to route the connection to an appropriate member.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>For DB2 for z/OS servers: collect server diagnostics, such as a z/OS SVC dump, for the application identifier that is reported as the connection correlation token (CRRTKN) and the logical unit of work ID (LUWID) in the z/OS diagnostic messages.</li>
</ol>

<p>In a DB2 pureScale environment, if a new member has been added you must wait for the activation operation to complete until you open subsequent connections to the database from the new member. Otherwise, connect from another existing member.</p>

<li>The application program issued a DROP TRIGGER or CREATE TRIGGER statement that affected the object, either directly or indirectly.</li>

<li>The application program issued a ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT statement, which placed the object in the modification pending state.</li>

<li>The application program issued a statement that caused all rows of a NOT LOGGED created temporary table or declared temporary table to be deleted.</li>

<li>The application program issued an  ALTER TABLE ... ADD PARTITION,  ALTER TABLE ... ATTACH PARTITION  or ALTER TABLE ... DETACH PARTITION statement against the  object (in this case a table).

<li>The application program issued a DETACH to create this object from a data partition in a partitioned MDC table.</li>

    <p>Modify the application program so there is no attempt to access an object within the same unit of work in which the modification was made. In general, it is better to isolate Data Definition Language (DDL) statements in a different unit of work than Data Manipulation Language (DML) statements that access the same objects.</p>

<p>The unit of work must be committed or rolled back before the statement that failed can be processed successfully. If the committed modification caused an object to be dropped, then the object may have to be recreated in order for the failing SQL statement to be processed successfully.</p>

<p>If the object is modified within a SAVEPOINT, modify the application  program so that it does not attempt to access the object after  the application issues a ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT statement. Any cursor that accesses the modified object and is open at the time of the ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT will not be accessible. Modify the application so that it closes the cursor.</p>

<p>If an insert, delete or update statement involving a NOT LOGGED created temporary table or declared temporary table fails, then all rows in that table are  deleted. Any cursor that is open against that table at the time of the failure will not be accessible and should be closed by the application.</p>

<p>If an ALTER TABLE ... DETACH PARTITION fails because of a pending  ALTER TABLE ... ATTACH PARTITION,  use two different units of work to do the two operations.</p>

<p>If the SQL statement attempted to access a trusted context object, then reissue the statement later.</p>

    <p>Terminate the application on receipt of this message (SQLCODE). Modify the  <var class="keyword varname">heap-name</var> configuration parameter to increase the heap or stack size.</p>

<p>If the <var class="keyword varname">heap-name</var>  configuration parameter is set to AUTOMATIC, you will need to increase the APPL_MEMORY database configuration setting,  the DATABASE_MEMORY database configuration settings, or the INSTANCE_MEMORY database manager configuration setting. Otherwise,  modify the <var class="keyword varname">heap-name</var> configuration parameter value to increase the heap size.</p>

<p>The package cache and catalog cache have soft limits.  For these you will need to increase the DATABASE_MEMORY database configuration setting or the INSTANCE_MEMORY database manager configuration setting.</p>

<p>When modifying the DATABASE_MEMORY database configuration parameter, setting the parameter to AUTOMATIC will tell the database manager to manage database memory automatically.</p>

<p>For the application shared heap size, you will need to increase either the APPL_MEMORY database configuration setting,  or the INSTANCE_MEMORY database manager configuration setting.</p>

<p>When updating configuration parameters, it is recommended to change them by 10% of the current size at a time until  the error condition is resolved.</p>

<p>For example, if <var class="keyword varname">heap-name</var> is UTIL_HEAP_SZ and the database name is TORDB1, to  update this database configuration parameter to 10000, issue the following command:</p>

<pre class="codeblock"><code>  db2 update db cfg
  for TORDB1
  using UTIL_HEAP_SZ 10000</code></pre>
<p>To view a list of the database configuration parameters, use the  GET DATABASE CONFIGURATION command.</p>

<p>To update a database manager configuration parameter, say MON_HEAP_SZ, to a new  size of 100, issue the following command:</p>

<pre class="codeblock"><code>  db2 update dbm cfg
  using MON_HEAP_SZ 100</code></pre>
<p>To view a list of the database manager configuration parameters,  use the GET DATABASE MANAGER CONFIGURATION command.</p>

<p>If all associated configuation parameters are set to either AUTOMATIC or COMPUTED, then the memory demands of the instance exceed the amount of memory configured on the machine.  Possible solutions include reducing the database workload, enabling the connection concentrator feature, or adding additional memory to the machine.</p>

<p>Increase the <em>dbheap</em> database configuration parameter to allow a larger database heap.  If the number of I/O servers is near the high limit, reducing this number might also help.</p>

<p>If the <em>dbheap</em> database configuration parameter is set to AUTOMATIC, you will need to increase either the DATABASE_MEMORY database configuration setting, or the INSTANCE_MEMORY database manager configuration setting.</p>

<p>When updating configuration parameters, it is recommended to change them by 10% of the current size at a time until the error condition is resolved.  To change <em>dbheap</em>, enter a command similar to the following, which sets <em>dbheap</em> to size 2400 for database <em>sample</em>:</p>

<pre class="codeblock"><code>db2 UPDATE DB CFG FOR sample

<p>To change dbheap when disconnected from the database, enter a command similar to the following</p>
 
<pre class="codeblock"><code>db2 CONNECT RESET;
db2 UPDATE DB CFG FOR sample

<p>If all associated configuation parameters are set to either AUTOMATIC or COMPUTED, then the memory demands of the instance exceed the amount of memory configured on the machine.

<p>The statement processing is terminated. Some changes may have been applied to the database, but not committed, before termination occurred.</p>

<p>You might also receive this error if Call Level Interface (CLI) issues an interrupt because a query timed out.  For example: if an application uses the SQLSetStmtAttr() function to configure the SQL_ATTR_QUERY_TIMEOUT statement attribute to a non-zero value, then if a SQL statement or XQuery expression does not complete in the specified amount of time, CLI will issue an interrupt to cancel the execution and return to the application.</p>

<p>If installing the sample database, drop it and install the sample database again.</p>

<p>If you want to prevent CLI from issuing an interrupt when a query times out, you can disable query timeout behavior by setting QUERYTIMEOUTINTERVAL=0 in the db2cli.ini file.  Disabling query timeout behavior will allow queries run to completion, unless there is a deadlock or lock wait timeout value set at the server.</p>

    <p>If this SQLCODE was returned because the cost category value
is
&quot;B&quot;, it might be that the statement is using
parameter markers or that some statistics are not available for
the referenced tables and columns.
Make sure the administrator has run the utility RUNSTATS
on the referenced tables.
It might also be that
UDFs will be invoked when the statement is executed, or
for INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statements that triggers
are defined on the changed table.
Check the DSN_STATEMNT_TABLE or the IFCID 22 record for this
statement to find the reasons this SQL statement has been put
in cost category &quot;B&quot;.
If the program cannot be changed, or if statistics cannot be
obtained, ask the administrator to change the value in the
RLF_CATEGORY_B column in the RLST to &quot;Y&quot; which allows
the statement to execute or &quot;W&quot; which returns a warning
instead of an error.</p>

<p>If the warning is caused by an SQL statement that is
consuming too much processor resource,
attempt to rewrite the statement to perform more efficiently.
Another option is to ask the administrator to
increase the error
threshold value in the RLST.</p>

<li>If possible, determine which file or directory the database manager or the db2fmp process itself was unable to access by reviewing available database diagnostic information (such as the db2diag log files) or operating system diagnostic information.</li>

<li>Compare the operating system permissions on DB2 database-related files and directories, including the sqllib directory and the db2fmp executable itself, with the documented default permissions that the database manager would have set when the instance and database directories were initially created.</li>

<li>210 - Only heuristic commits are allowed for this transaction. Some nodes are already in commit state.</li>

<li>221 - The version of DBMS on the host requires that all applications that participate in the same XA transaction use the same user ID to connect to the database.</li>

<li>222 - The version of DBMS on the host requires that all applications that participate the same XA transaction have the same CCSID.</li>

    <p>For reason codes 1 through 8, an entry will be made in the system log because sometimes the SQLCA cannot be returned to the caller.</p>

<p>If the error is due to a failed data source associated with a nickname, the location of the failed data source will always appear in federated server&#39;s system log.</p>

<p>For reason code 4, verify the content of the xa open string and make necessary corrections.</p>

<p>For reason code 4, subcode 11, ensure xa_config file exists in $SYBASE/$SYBASE_OCS directory and the LRM name that is specified as the NODE server option exists in the file.</p>

<p>For reason code 9, subcode 02, ensure that the tp_mon_name configuration parameter contains the name of the dynamic library in the external product which has the ax_reg() function used for dynamic registration of transactions.</p>

<p>For reason code 14, ensure that the MSDTC service is active.</p>

<p>For reason code 15, this error may occur when the MSDTC transaction timeout value is too low. Increase the timeout value and see if the error continues.</p>

<p>For reason code 16:</p>

<ul>
<li>subcode 01, ensure that the MSDTC service is active.</li>

<li>subcode 02, MSDTC was unable to register the connection. For more information refer to the db2diag log file or the Windows Event Viewer for an entry titled MicrosoftXARMCreate.</li>

<li>subcode 03, MSDTC was unable to enlist the connection into a Transaction. For more information refer to the db2diag log file or the Windows Event Viewer for an entry titled MicrosoftEnlishWithRM. The most common error is that the current transaction has been explicitly or implicitly rolled back. This may occur when the MSDTC transaction timeout is too low. Increase the timeout value and see if the error continues.</li>

<li>subcode 04, there has been an attempt to enlist a connection that is currently active in a different distributed transaction.</li>

<li>subcode 05, enlist the connection before attempting to issue an SQL statement.</li>
</ul>

<p>For reason code 35, you attempted to perform a heuristic operation against a database that only participates as a read-only resource manager in a global transaction.  Examples are any DRDA databases such as DB2 on MVS. These type of non-XA databases would not have any XA indoubt transactions.</p>

<p>For reason codes 36, 37, and 38, you attempted to perform an invalid heuristic operation on an indoubt transaction. Either you specified the wrong XID, or a heuristic or resync operation had taken place since you recorded this XID. Perform a Heuristic Query request to get the current list of indoubt transactions to verify if you still need to perform your heuristic operation.</p>

<p>For reason code 39, the XID specified is for a transaction that has ended and is waiting for the two-phase commit process to begin. You can only perform heuristic operations on transactions that have entered the two-phase commit process and become indoubt transactions.</p>

<p>For reason code 40, an SQL statement was attempted under a transaction which has failed.  An example of this is to attempt an SQL statement in a transaction thread that has successfully registered after a tightly coupled thread participating in the same transaction has abnormally terminated.</p>

<p>For reason code 41, you can find more information about the problem in the administration notification log. You need to restart the database manager on the failed nodes. It may be necessary to contact the system administrator for assistance.</p>

<p>For reason code 42, an outbound connection can be established by modifying the gateway catalogs to use TCPIP communication protocol.</p>

<p>For reason code 43, if connecting to DB2 for z/OS server or DB2 for i server, catalog the database using DB2 Connect and then start the sync point manager.</p>

<p>For reason code 69, either the transaction manager (TM) database or the resource manager (RM) database or both are different from the ones when the indoubt transaction was generated. In other words, the TM database or RM database names could be referencing different database instances. The log ID mismatch may be caused by the following reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>The database directory for the TM database at the RM instance is incorrect.</li>

<li>The configuration may have been changed after the indoubt transaction was generated.</li>

<li>The database may have been dropped and recreated. In that case, you can only commit or rollback the indoubt transaction heuristically.</li>
</ul>

<p>For reason code 85, you are updating multiple data sources, and some of the data sources have been heuristically rolled back or committed, resulting in the transaction having partially committed and rolled back.  With this reason code data is now in an inconsistent state, you must manually check every data source updated by the transaction to correct the data.</p>

<p>For reason code 210, some of the nodes are already in commit state. You have to perform heuristic commit to resolve the indoubt transaction.</p>

<p>For reason code 221, ensure all applications that participate in the same XA transaction use the same user ID to connect to the database.</p>

<p>For reason code 222, ensure all applications that participate in the same XA transaction have the same CCSID.</p>

<p>For reason code 223, modify the application and client set-up to use local clients, or for remote clients use TCPIP as the communication protocol to connect to the gateway.</p>

<p>For reason code 224, update the client to version 7.1 or later.</p>

<p>For reason code 225, ensure the application did not contain any of the invalid operations in an XA Loosely Coupled Transaction. Common application server environments where XA Loosely Coupled Transaction can be used are IBM Encina Transaction Server, IBM WebSphere Application Server, Microsoft Transaction Server, and BEA Tuxedo. If you encounter this reason code, then you must review your application and ensure none of the indicated actions are performed.</p>

<p>For reason code 226, the transaction has reached a rollback state, and is now rolled back on this node.</p>

<p>For reason code 227, heuristic request should be run on the coordinator node, see the db2diag log file for the coordinator node number.</p>

<p>For reason code 228, ensure that the cursors are closed prior to issuing the request.</p>

<p>For reason code 229, ensure that the previous transaction is complete prior to issuing the request.</p>

<p>For reason code 230, the transaction has already been committed.</p>

<p>General information collection procedure:</p>

<p>If you cannot resolve the problem identified by the reason codes, record the message number (SQLCODE), reason code, and the optional subcode in the message or the SQLCA in the system log.</p>

<p>If the failure is from a federated database, you should also record the location of the failed data source found in the federated server&#39;s system log.</p>

<p>If trace was active, invoke the Independent Trace Facility at the operating system command prompt. Then, contact your technical service representative with the following information:</p>

<ul>
<li>Problem description</li>

<li>SQLCODE, embedded reason code, and subcode</li>

<li>SQLCA contents (if possible)</li>

<li>Trace file (if possible)</li>

<li>Location of the failed data source if the failure is from a federated server.</li>
</ul>

    <p>Execution of the SQL statement failed because the requested
function had been disabled by a prior error.  This situation can arise if
the application program has intercepted an abend (for instance, by an ON
ERROR condition in a PL/I program) and continued to execute SQL

encountered a create thread error yet continued to issue SQL requests

    <p>In general, an application program should terminate
upon receipt of this return code.  All subsequent attempts by the
application to execute other SQL statements will also fail with the same
return code.  In the case of a DB2 CICS transaction, if the SQLERRP field
in the SQLCA contains the module name DSNCEXT1, the transaction may issue
a SYNCPOINT ROLLBACK and continue processing.  If the transactions chooses
to ROLLBACK and continue processing, it must be capable of correcting the
situation that caused the create thread error to occur originally.</p>

<ul>
<li>To verify if a log file is missing, check the db2diag log file for the presence of a  logging error (return code contains SQLO_FNEX). If present, this error will contain  the name of the missing log file. Ensure that the file is located in the active log  path directory. If the file cannot be located, restore and roll-forward the database  to an earlier point in time referenced in a log file preceding the missing log file  (use a timestamp that is earlier than that of the missing file).</li>

<li>There may be a problem with the database directory. Check the integrity of the  directory. Examples of potential problems include: permissions issues, mount point problems, corruption.</li>

<li>Increase filesystem size.</li>
</ul>

<p>NOTE: If the error occurred during CREATE DATABASE or DROP DATABASE, a subsequent CREATE DATABASE or DROP DATABASE command attempts to erase files and directories left from the unsuccessful CREATE DATABASE or DROP DATABASE command.</p>

You might need to contact the person responsible for the SMTP server to have them fix the error with the SMTP server or you might choose a different SMTP server.</p>

<p>If <var class="keyword varname">protocol</var> is TCP/IP, here are descriptions of some common scenarios:</p>

<ul>
<li>Reason codes <var class="keyword varname">rc1</var>, <var class="keyword varname">rc2</var>, <var class="keyword varname">rc3</var> represent: 
<ul>
<li>If present, <var class="keyword varname">rc1</var> contains the errno returned by the  TCP/IP function. On Windows, this is a WSA errno.</li>

<li>If present, <var class="keyword varname">rc2</var> contains the h_errno value returned by a TCP/IP name resolution function. On Windows, this is a WSA error number.</li>

<li>If <var class="keyword varname">rc3</var> is present and contains &quot;0&quot;, the remote side has  terminated the connection. If the error was received on the  client, then the remote side could be a server or gateway. If  the error was received on the gateway, the remote side could be  the client or server.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>If <var class="keyword varname">protocol</var> = TCP/IP, <var class="keyword varname">rc1</var>=*, <var class="keyword varname">rc2</var>=*, and <var class="keyword varname">rc3</var>=0, possible causes include: 
<ul>
<li>The database agent at the server was forced off by the system administrator.</li>

<li>A database agent could not be started at the server because a memory limitation was reached on the system.</li>

<li>The connection might have been closed by the remote server at the TCP/IP level.</li>

<li>The database agent at the server was terminated due to an abnormal termination of a key database manager process.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>On Windows, if <var class="keyword varname">protocol</var> = TCP/IP, <var class="keyword varname">function</var> = WSAStartup,  and <var class="keyword varname">rc1</var> = 0, then <var class="keyword varname">rc2</var> contains the Windows Sockets  Specification version level requested by DB2, and <var class="keyword varname">rc3</var> contains  the Windows Sockets Specification version level supported by the Windows  Sockets DLL. Cause: There was a version level mismatch.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>If <var class="keyword varname">protocol</var> = TCP/IP, <var class="keyword varname">function</var> = connect, <var class="keyword varname">rc1</var> = ECONNREFUSED/WSAECONNREFUSED, AIX (79), Windows (10061), linux (111), SUN (146), HP (239), the attempt to connect was rejected. Possible causes: 
<ul>
<li>The remote database server has not been cataloged correctly  at the client. In a client-gateway-server scenario, ensure  the host entries are cataloged correctly on the gateway.</li>

<li>The database manager configuration file at the server has not  been configured properly with the proper communication  parameters. Check that the SVCENAME database manager configuration parameter has been configured properly  with the TCP/IP service name or port number and that the port  number is unique. If database manager configuration parameters  have been updated at the server, the database manager must be  stopped and re-started for the changes to take effect. There  might be a mismatch between the TCP/IP service name or port  number specified on the server and on the client. Ensure the  service name maps to the correct port number by checking the  services file. You can check this by reading the services file  or checking the output from running the command &quot;netstat -a&quot;.</li>

<li>A firewall at the remote database server has prevented the connection from being established. Verify that the firewall is properly configured to accept connection requests from the client.</li>

<li>The DB2COMM environment variable at the server does not  specify the communication protocol used  by the client.  Check that TCPIP has been specified. Issue db2set to see  what has already been set. Run the command &quot;db2set DB2COMM=TCPIP&quot;  to set the value.</li>

<li>The database manager at the server has not been started, or  has not been started successfully, or has gone down. The  server should have returned SQL1063N, and not SQL5043N. If  you set the database manager configuration parameter DIAGLEVEL to 4 using the command &quot;db2 update dbm cfg using diaglevel 4&quot; prior to issuing the &quot;db2start&quot; command, then the administration notification  log will provide detailed information on which protocols  were started successfully. Check the administration  notification log.</li>

<li>The server might be too busy to handle the volume of incoming connections at this time.</li>

<li>Network failure, contact your network administrator.  You can try a test using the protocol tester, pctt,  to verify this is not a DB2 problem.</li>

Possible causes: 
<ul>
<li>An incorrect host name or IP address was cataloged in the hostname field of the node directory on the client and/or gateway.</li>

<li>The network is slow, or the server might be too busy to respond to the connect request within a reasonable amount of time, you might need to adjust your system TCP connect timeout value and/or the DB2TCP_CLIENT_CONTIMEOUT value.</li>

Possible causes: 
<ul>
<li>The connection might have been closed by the remote gateway or  server at the TCP/IP level (eg. firewall problem, power failure,  network failure).</li>

<li>Client side connection pooling is enabled and is not handling connection failures. Code the application to retry a connection if a failure is received when connecting to the database and connection pooling is enabled.</li>

<li>Might have been caused by a thread timeout on the host machine. Check the  system log on the host for the presence of the IDTHTOIN message.  Adjust the setting if applicable. If this cannot be adjusted, either  disable connection pooling on the gateway, or ensure all objects  are properly closed (eg. cursors with hold when the application  completes its operation).</li>

Possible causes: 
<ul>
<li>SQLCancel() was called from a CLI application because the application  set the Query Timeout value or there was an explicit cancel request.  Adjust the Query Timeout value set by the application. If this is  not possible, adjust the QueryTimeoutInterval setting in the  db2cli.ini file. Use QueryTimeoutInterval=0 (no timeout) in the  db2cli.ini file to test whether QueryTimeout is the cause of your  application&#39;s failure. The failure of an existing connection is  expected in this scenario.</li>

<li>The network is slow, or the server might be too busy to respond to the recv request within a reasonable amount of time, you might need to adjust your system TCP recv timeout value.</li>
