<li>Move the specified log file into the database log directory and restart the operation.</li>

<li>If an overflow log path can be specified, restart the operation with the overflow log path, specifying the path that contains the log file.</li>
</ul>

<p>If the missing log file cannot be found, determine whether one of the following special cases applies:</p>

<ul>
<li>If the operation is a ROLLFORWARD DATABASE command to maintain a standby system through log shipping, this error might be normal, because some files that are available on the primary site might not yet be available on the standby system. To ensure that your standby system is up-to-date, issue a ROLLFORWARD DATABASE command with the QUERY STATUS option after each rollforward operation to verify that the log replay is progressing properly. If you find that a rollforward operation on the standby system is not making progress over an extended period of time, determine why the log file that is reported as missing is not available on the standby system, and correct the problem. Note that the ARCHIVE LOG command can be used to truncate currently active log files on the primary system, making them eligible for archiving and subsequent replay on the standby system.</li>

<li>If a ROLLFORWARD DATABASE command with the TO END OF LOGS option was issued following a restore operation from an online backup image in which the only available logs are those that were included in the backup image, there are two possible scenarios to consider: 
<ul>
<li>Scenario 1: All of the log files contained in the backup image are found by the rollforward operation. However, the rollforward operation still looks for log files that were updated following the original backup operation. Bring the database to a consistent state by issuing the ROLLFORWARD DATABASE command with the STOP option (without the TO END OF LOGS option). To avoid this scenario in the future, use the END OF BACKUP option instead of the END OF LOGS option, because the rollforward operation will not look for log files that were updated after the backup was taken.</li>

<li>Scenario 2: One or more log files that were contained in the backup image were not found by the rollforward operation. These log files are required to bring the database to a consistent state. Attempting to bring the database to a consistent state by issuing the ROLLFORWARD DATABASE command with the STOP option (without the TO END OF LOGS option) will fail with SQL1273N; recover the missing log file, as described earlier in this section.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>If the missing log file cannot be recovered:</p>

<ul>
<li>If the operation is a ROLLFORWARD DATABASE command, you can issue the ROLLFORWARD DATABASE command again with the STOP option (without the END OF LOGS option or the END OF BACKUP option) to bring the database to a consistent state. If this consistency point (immediately prior to the missing log file) is not acceptable, you can restore the database and roll forward to any point in time that is prior to the missing log file by providing an earlier time stamp to the ROLLFORWARD DATABASE command.</li>

<li>If the operation is a ROLLFORWARD DATABASE command with the STOP or COMPLETE option (without the END OF LOGS option or the END OF BACKUP option), the missing log file is needed to bring the database to a consistent state. Because you cannot recover the missing log file, you must restore and roll forward to an earlier point in time (as long as that point in time is not prior to the minimum recovery time).</li>

<li>If the operation is a call to the db2ReadLog or db2ReadLogNoConn API for the purpose of replicating data, resynchronize the replicated tables and terminate the current connection being used by the API. If the API is being used to maintain a disaster recovery site, a backup image that was created after the last time stamp in the missing log file must be restored to the disaster recovery site before any subsequent API calls can complete successfully. If the API is being used for any other purpose, terminate the connection being used by the API and deactivate the database. In all cases, restart the scan by creating a new connection to the database and calling the API with the query action. Use the nextStartLRI as the piStartLRI on the next call to the API.</li>

The inline length cannot be smaller than 292 and the size returned by the constructor function for the structured type.</li>

<li>For a CREATE VARIABLE statement, <var class="keyword varname">data-item</var> gives the name of the variable having an incorrect data type.

<li>subcode 05, enlist the connection before attempting to issue an SQL statement.</li>

<p>For reason code 35, you attempted to perform a heuristic operation against a database that only participates as a read-only resource manager in a global transaction.  Examples are any DRDA databases such as DB2 on MVS. These type of non-XA databases would not have any XA indoubt transactions.</p>

<p>For reason codes 36, 37, and 38, you attempted to perform an invalid heuristic operation on an indoubt transaction. Either you specified the wrong XID, or a heuristic or resync operation had taken place since you recorded this XID. Perform a Heuristic Query request to get the current list of indoubt transactions to verify if you still need to perform your heuristic operation.</p>

<p>For reason code 39, the XID specified is for a transaction that has ended and is waiting for the two-phase commit process to begin. You can only perform heuristic operations on transactions that have entered the two-phase commit process and become indoubt transactions.</p>

<p>For reason code 40, an SQL statement was attempted under a transaction which has failed.  An example of this is to attempt an SQL statement in a transaction thread that has successfully registered after a tightly coupled thread participating in the same transaction has abnormally terminated.</p>

<p>For reason code 41, you can find more information about the problem in the administration notification log. You need to restart the database manager on the failed nodes. It may be necessary to contact the system administrator for assistance.</p>

<p>For reason code 42, an outbound connection can be established by modifying the gateway catalogs to use TCPIP communication protocol.</p>

<p>For reason code 43, if connecting to DB2 for z/OS server or DB2 for i server, catalog the database using DB2 Connect and then start the sync point manager.</p>

<p>For reason code 69, either the transaction manager (TM) database or the resource manager (RM) database or both are different from the ones when the indoubt transaction was generated. In other words, the TM database or RM database names could be referencing different database instances. The log ID mismatch may be caused by the following reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>The database directory for the TM database at the RM instance is incorrect.</li>

<li>The configuration may have been changed after the indoubt transaction was generated.</li>

<li>The database may have been dropped and recreated. In that case, you can only commit or rollback the indoubt transaction heuristically.</li>
</ul>

<p>For reason code 85, you are updating multiple data sources, and some of the data sources have been heuristically rolled back or committed, resulting in the transaction having partially committed and rolled back.  With this reason code data is now in an inconsistent state, you must manually check every data source updated by the transaction to correct the data.</p>

<p>For reason code 210, some of the nodes are already in commit state. You have to perform heuristic commit to resolve the indoubt transaction.</p>

<p>For reason code 221, ensure all applications that participate in the same XA transaction use the same user ID to connect to the database.</p>

<p>For reason code 222, ensure all applications that participate in the same XA transaction have the same CCSID.</p>

<p>For reason code 223, modify the application and client set-up to use local clients, or for remote clients use TCPIP as the communication protocol to connect to the gateway.</p>

<p>For reason code 224, update the client to version 7.1 or later.</p>

<p>For reason code 225, ensure the application did not contain any of the invalid operations in an XA Loosely Coupled Transaction. Common application server environments where XA Loosely Coupled Transaction can be used are IBM Encina Transaction Server, IBM WebSphere Application Server, Microsoft Transaction Server, and BEA Tuxedo. If you encounter this reason code, then you must review your application and ensure none of the indicated actions are performed.</p>

<p>For reason code 226, the transaction has reached a rollback state, and is now rolled back on this node.</p>

<p>For reason code 227, heuristic request should be run on the coordinator node, see the db2diag log file for the coordinator node number.</p>

<p>For reason code 228, ensure that the cursors are closed prior to issuing the request.</p>

<p>For reason code 229, ensure that the previous transaction is complete prior to issuing the request.</p>

<p>For reason code 230, the transaction has already been committed.</p>

<p>General information collection procedure:</p>

<p>If you cannot resolve the problem identified by the reason codes, record the message number (SQLCODE), reason code, and the optional subcode in the message or the SQLCA in the system log.</p>

<p>If the failure is from a federated database, you should also record the location of the failed data source found in the federated server&#39;s system log.</p>

<p>If trace was active, invoke the Independent Trace Facility at the operating system command prompt. Then, contact your technical service representative with the following information:</p>

<ul>
<li>The remote database server has not been cataloged correctly  at the client. In a client-gateway-server scenario, ensure  the host entries are cataloged correctly on the gateway.</li>

<li>The database manager configuration file at the server has not  been configured properly with the proper communication  parameters. Check that the SVCENAME database manager configuration parameter has been configured properly  with the TCP/IP service name or port number and that the port  number is unique. If database manager configuration parameters  have been updated at the server, the database manager must be  stopped and re-started for the changes to take effect. There  might be a mismatch between the TCP/IP service name or port  number specified on the server and on the client. Ensure the  service name maps to the correct port number by checking the  services file. You can check this by reading the services file  or checking the output from running the command &quot;netstat -a&quot;.</li>

<li>A firewall at the remote database server has prevented the connection from being established. Verify that the firewall is properly configured to accept connection requests from the client.</li>

<li>The DB2COMM environment variable at the server does not  specify the communication protocol used  by the client.  Check that TCPIP has been specified. Issue db2set to see  what has already been set. Run the command &quot;db2set DB2COMM=TCPIP&quot;  to set the value.</li>

<li>The database manager at the server has not been started, or  has not been started successfully, or has gone down. The  server should have returned SQL1063N, and not SQL5043N. If  you set the database manager configuration parameter DIAGLEVEL to 4 using the command &quot;db2 update dbm cfg using diaglevel 4&quot; prior to issuing the &quot;db2start&quot; command, then the administration notification  log will provide detailed information on which protocols  were started successfully.

<li>Determine whether the database manager is up and running.</li>

<li>Review the db2diag log files for evidence that a database manager process was interrupted or terminated abnormally.</li>

<li>If the database manager is stopped, or if there is evidence in the diagnostic logs of any database manager agents being interrupted or terminating abnormally, restart the database manager.</li>
</ol>
</li>

<li>Ensure that the user ID has authority: 
<ul>
<li>If the database or instance was quiesced, take one of the following actions: 
<ul>
<li>Unquiesce the database or instance.</li>

<li>Add the user ID to the group that has CONNECT QUIESCE authority.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>In Windows operating system environments: If Extended Security is enabled, add the appropriate user ID to the local Windows security group DB2USERS or DB2ADMNS.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Remove any database directory conflicts: 
<ol type="a">
<li>Compare the contents of the local database directory and the system catalog to the database configuration.  In particular, look for the following problems: 
<ul>
<li>Ensure that no two databases have the same name or alias as each other.</li>

<li>Ensure that local database are cataloged as local, and that any remote databases are cataloged as remote.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>After making any changes to the ways databases have been cataloged, stop and restart the database manager instance.</li>
</ol>
</li>

<li>Make necessary configuration and application changes to avoid exceeding database or operating system limits:
<p>Determine which limit was exceeded by reviewing db2diag log files, and then make one or more of the following changes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Reduce the chance of applications being forced off for using too much transaction log space by make one or more of the following changes: 
<ul>
<li>Alter the application to issue more frequent commit statements.</li>

<li>Increase the max_log database configuration parameter or the num_log_span database configuration parameter.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Reduce the chance of applications being forced off because there are insufficient coordinator agents by make one or more of the following changes: 
<ul>
<li>Increase the value of max_coordagents relative to the value of max_connections.</li>

<li>Reduce the use of WITH HOLD cursors.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Reduce the chance of connections being closed for being idle for too long by increasing the CONNECTIONIDLETIME threshold.</li>

<li>Reduce the chance of connections being closed because a unit of work is taking too long to execute by increasing the UOWTOTALTIME threshold.</li>

<li>Reduce the chance of queries timing out by increasing the SQL_ATTR_QUERY_TIMEOUT statement attribute or using the QueryTimeoutInterval CLI/ODBC configuration keyword.</li>

<li>In AIX, 32-bit environments: reduce the chance of running out of AIX shared memory by making one or more of the following changes: 
<ul>
<li>Catalog the database as a loopback data source using TCP/IP.</li>

<li>If the application is using multiple contexts with local protocol, then either reduce the number of connections in the application, or switch to another protocol, such as TCP/IP.</li>

<li>Set the EXTSHM parameter if the application supports the EXTSHM parameter and if there are sufficient memory resources to use the parameter.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Alter the application as needed to avoid unsupported usage scenarios: 
<ul>
<li>To avoid connecting to a DB2 member that is in restart light mode, either specify a member that is not in restart light mode, or do not specify any specific member and allow the database manager to route the connection to an appropriate member.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>For DB2 for z/OS servers: collect server diagnostics, such as a z/OS SVC dump, for the application identifier that is reported as the connection correlation token (CRRTKN) and the logical unit of work ID (LUWID) in the z/OS diagnostic messages.</li>
</ol>

<p>In a DB2 pureScale environment, if a new member has been added you must wait for the activation operation to complete until you open subsequent connections to the database from the new member. Otherwise, connect from another existing member.</p>

<li>An ALTER DATABASE PARTITION statement used to add a database partition used the containers of a LIKE database partition that is on the same physical database partition. These containers would therefore already be in use.</li>

<li>An ADD DATABASE PARTITION command or API used the containers from the system temporary table spaces of a LIKE database partition that is on the same physical database partition. These containers would therefore already be in use.</li>

<li>A CREATE TABLESPACE statement, ALTER TABLESPACE statement, or CREATE DATABASE command  included a DMS container from another database that no longer exists but  was not dropped properly.  The container is not actually in    use but it is tagged as being in use.  Therefore, the DB2 data server will not allow it to be used until it is untagged.

For example: if an application uses the SQLSetStmtAttr() function to configure the SQL_ATTR_QUERY_TIMEOUT statement attribute to a non-zero value, then if a SQL statement or XQuery expression does not complete in the specified amount of time, CLI will issue an interrupt to cancel the execution and return to the application.</p>

<p>The package cache and catalog cache have soft limits.  For these you will need to increase the DATABASE_MEMORY database configuration setting or the INSTANCE_MEMORY database manager configuration setting.</p>

  for TORDB1
  using UTIL_HEAP_SZ 10000</code></pre>
<p>To view a list of the database configuration parameters, use the  GET DATABASE CONFIGURATION command.</p>

<p>To update a database manager configuration parameter, say MON_HEAP_SZ, to a new  size of 100, issue the following command:</p>

<pre class="codeblock"><code>  db2 update dbm cfg
  using MON_HEAP_SZ 100</code></pre>
<p>To view a list of the database manager configuration parameters,  use the GET DATABASE MANAGER CONFIGURATION command.</p>

<p>If all associated configuation parameters are set to either AUTOMATIC or COMPUTED, then the memory demands of the instance exceed the amount of memory configured on the machine.

Although forcing the standby database to takeover outside a peer window is supported, the risk of transaction loss is greater when the takeover happens outside a peer window.</p>

<p>If your primary database failed and you do not want to force the standby database to take over outside a peer window because of the risk of data or transaction loss, consider alternative responses to the failure of the primary database than a forced takeover.</p>

<p>In a high availability solution with a primary database and a standby database, a common strategy for responding to the failure of the primary database is to have the standby database take over database operations for the failed primary database.  However, there are other strategies for responding to a failure of the primary database, including repairing and restarting the failed primary database instead of failing over to a standby database.  Although this repair and restart strategy would have a larger negative impact on the availability of the database solution for user applications than the failover strategy, it has other strengths such as less risk of data or transaction loss.</p>
