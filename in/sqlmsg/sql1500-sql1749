<p>Public aliases are not supported in a DB2 environment that is configured for SAP.  This message is returned when an attempt is made to create a public alias when the system environment variable named DB2_WORKLOAD is set to the value SAP.</p>

<p>There are several ways to refer to objects outside of the local schema without creating public aliases, including: using full-qualified names, or creating local aliases. In the following examples, the local schema is called "schemaA" and there is a table called "tableX" in a different schema, called "schemaB".</p>

<dt class="dlterm">Example 1: Using fully-qualified names</dt>

<dd class="dlentry"><p>You could refer to tableX using a fully-qualified name:</p>

<p>There are multiple scenarios that can lead to this error being returned, including the following scenarios:</p>

<ul>
<li>A database agent could not be started at the remote computer because of a memory allocation failure.</li>

<li>A database agent was forced off of the remote computer.</li>

<p>The fenced user ID needs to be able to access DB2 database-related files, such as executable and library files, in the sqllib directory and other instance and database directories.

<p>This message can be returned when you are working with fenced stored procedures or routines directly, or when a DB2 utility, such as the health monitor, runs as a fenced mode process.</p>

<p>The most common cause of this error is that the operating system file permissions for DB2 database-related files or directories were accidentally changed after the database manager created the instance and database directories.</p>

<li>Compare the operating system permissions on DB2 database-related files and directories, including the sqllib directory and the db2fmp executable itself, with the documented default permissions that the database manager would have set when the instance and database directories were initially created.</li>
